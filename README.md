Here files for making animated plots of rank acquisition
from interaction data. To use the script right out of the box: 
  
    1) download all files in the github repo to a single folder
    2) open the .Rproj file in Rstudio
    3) in Rstudio, open the script
    4) make sure all required packages and ImageMagick are installed
    5) run the script

To use the script on its own (i.e., without the .Rproj file), you will need to 
modify the here() calls. here() references the location of the project file. 
To avoid using here() and the .Rproj file, simply replace the here() calls with
direct filepaths to the relevant files/folders.
